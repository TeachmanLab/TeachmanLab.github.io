          Diversity and Inclusion at the University of Virginia in the Department of Psychology. She received her PhD from Yale
          University, and her BA from the University of British Columbia. Her lab investigates biases in cognitive processing
          that contribute to the development and maintenance of psychopathology, especially anxiety disorders. The lab also
          does work on technology-based assessments and interventions, including mobile monitoring of mood and emotion
          regulation and web-based interventions to reduce anxious thinking. She has had continuous funding from the National
          Institutes of Health and private foundations, and is an author on over 175 publications, including books on
          treatment planning and eating disorders.</p>

          an Association for Psychological Science Fellow. Currently, Dr. Teachman is Chair of the Coalition for the
          Advancement and Application of Psychological Science and Director of the public web sites MindTrails and
          Project Implicit Health, and she is past president of the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology.
          She received a Presidential Citation from the American Psychological Association in 2019 for “her leadership

          <p class="lab" align="justify">Katharine Daniel, MA, is a PhD candidate in clinical psychology with a secondary concentration in 
            quantitative psychology at the University of Virginia. While at UVA, Katie was a graduate student researcher in the Department 
            of Psychology’s Program for Anxiety, Cognition, and Treatment Lab and in the School of Medicine’s Department of Family Medicine and Center 
            for Behavior Health and Technology. She has been supported by a PEO Scholar Award, a Jefferson Scholars Foundation Fellowship, and an 
            International Max Planck Institute for Human Development Fellowship. She is currently completing her clinical internship at Massachusetts 
            General Hospital/Harvard Medical School on the CBT track at the Center for Digital Mental Health and the Center for OCD and Related Disorders. 
            Katie’s research uses real-time monitoring and intensive longitudinal analytic methods to understand the real-world effects of anxiety and emotion dysregulation across changing contexts to inform the development of technology-assisted interventions. She is particularly interested in leveraging actively- and passively-sensed data to personalize the content and timing of mHealth interventions.

        <p class=lab align="justify">Jeremy Eberle is a PhD candidate in clinical psychology also pursuing a minor in 
          quantitative psychology. His research seeks to elucidate the cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes that
          maintain emotional disorders and the pathways by which psychological treatments can change those processes. By 
          identifying mechanisms of disorder and change, he hopes to advance the development and dissemination of optimized, 
          streamlined, and personalized interventions. He also has interests in methodology and open science. Jeremy is a member 
          of the Raven Society and the department's outgoing student representative for the Psychological Clinical Science 
          Accreditation System. He received a BS in psychology and BA in philosophy from Tulane University and an MA in clinical
          psychology from the University of Virginia. He is currently on clinical internship at the Stony Brook University 
          Consortium Internship Program and working in the Lab for Scalable Mental Health at Northwestern University.

            understand the everyday experiences of individuals with anxiety and related disorders, and to improve our 
            prediction and treatment of these disorders. I hope to use this research to develop novel digital mental health 
            interventions that use passive sensing and prediction to deliver treatment when it is most beneficial. I am also 
            interested in understanding the systemic factors and everyday minority stressors that contribute to higher rates of 
            mental illness among transgender, gender diverse, and LGBTQ+ individuals.</p><br/><br/>
